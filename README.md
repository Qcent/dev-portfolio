# Development Portfolio

This is a [Web Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page) to showcase my development portfolio, comprised of class projects and more personal ones. And one day, perhaps, even a professional project.

## Project Objectives
 Meet all challenge criteria and Mock-Up objectives while relying on advanced CSS to accomplish site design and styling. Going against better practises, I will include many CSS animations and transitions to breathe some life and excitement into an otherwise perfectly fine looking website.
